## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}

library(readr)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
library(randomForest)
library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)
library(caret)
library(adabag)
library(ipred)

# Read csv
red <- read.csv(file.choose(), header = T)
red

#Modifying the variables
red$quality <- as.factor(red$quality)
red$rating <- ifelse(red$quality == 7 & red$quality == 8, "Excellent", ifelse(red$quality == 5 & red$quality == 6, "Normal", "Poor"))
red$rating <- as.factor(red$rating)

# Update the names of variables
colnames(red)[1] <- c("fixed_acidity") 
colnames(red)[2] <- c("volatile_acidity") 
colnames(red)[3] <- c("citric_acid") 
colnames(red)[4] <- c("residual_sugar") 
colnames(red)[6] <- c("free_sulfur_dioxide") 
colnames(red)[7] <- c("total_sulfur_dioxide")


# Training & Validation
set.seed(123)
train.index <- sample(c(1:dim(red)[1]), dim(red)[1] * 0.8)
train.df <- red[train.index, ]
valid.df <- red[-train.index, ]



# Random Forest
red.rf <- randomForest(quality ~ ., data = train.df, ntree = 500, mtry = 4, nodesize = 8, importance = TRUE)
red.rf

```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

varImpPlot(red.rf, type = 1, col = rainbow(18))

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
